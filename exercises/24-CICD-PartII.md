# CI/CD Pipeline Enhancements

## Introduction

> This exercise is an **optional** stretch goal. If you are short on time, you may wish to work on this exercise after the workshop. Please proceed to the [next exercise](./25-CleanUp.md) to clean up your environment.

In this exercise, we will be extending the CI/CD pipeline you created in the [previous exercise](./22-Docker-Image.md) ...

Leveraging on these tools allows Developers to detect and prevent defects in their codebase earlier in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) more frequently. This is known as "Shift-Left Testing" in DevOps, and it fully embodies the "Test early and often" mantra typically seen in Agile organizations practicing iterative development.

## Prerequisites

You should have completed all previous exercises:

1. [DevOps Setup](./20-DevOps.md)
2. [Deploy Frontend to the Cloud](./21-CICD-PartI.md)
3. [Docker Images](./22-Docker-Images.md)
4. [Infrastructure-as-Code](./23-InfrastructureAsCode.md)

### TFSec

### Automated Dependency Updating

Purpose of Dependabot

Task

### Further Stretch Goals

These won't have any solutions

- Caching
- Further reduce the size of the images
